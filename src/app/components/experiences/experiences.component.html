          <p class="display-18 fw-lighter">
            The Gangteng Monastery, also called the Gangteng Sangngak Ch√∂ling, was established by
            Gangteng Truelku Pema Thinley following Pema Lingpa's prophecies. Pema Lingpa is the
            most revered and celebrated saint of Bhutanese origin. Hence, the Monastery is one of
            Bhutan's most important Buddhist establishments and a proud jewel of all the community
            members. It is a symbol of peace, Prosperity, and hope. When the black-necked cranes
            arrive in Gangtey, they circle above Gangtey Monastery three times before landing on the
            marsh. They will also repeat the ritual before they depart from Bhutan to Tibet. The
            architecture and engineering highlight the uniqueness and elegance of traditional
            Bhutanese architecture, and we recommend experiencing the monastic lifestyle of monks
            and join the prayer for the most surreal spiritual evening.
