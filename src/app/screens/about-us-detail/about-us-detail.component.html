        <p class="display-18 me-0 me-md-60">
          Hotel Yue Lo Ki was established in 2010 as a small guest house with six rooms and five staff. The
          initial idea was just a small farmhouse next to the old carpet factory to increase their sales of textile
          goods. Gradually the small guesthouse scaled into a small Hotel with the restructuring of the old
          carpet factory to a new building with ten rooms.

          Hotel Yue Lo Ki has 16 rooms with 11 twin beds and four king-size beds. All the rooms have rich and
          elegant wooden panels that provide excellent acoustics insulation, great for the cold Phobjikha
          valley. The walls of windows offer a great view of the valley, with plenty of biodiversity surrounding
          the hotel. All the rooms have electronic heaters, central water heating systems, and modern shower
          cabinets to accommodate an excellent shower session after trekking the beautiful trails in the valley.
